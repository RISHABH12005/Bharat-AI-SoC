# INMP441 MEMS High Precision

## INMP441 Micro Electro Mechanical System High Precision Omnidirectional Microphone Module (I2S)

The **INMP441** is a high-performance, low-power, digital-output, omnidirectional MEMS microphone with a bottom port.  

The complete INMP441 solution consists of a MEMS sensor, signal conditioning, analog-to-digital converter, anti-aliasing filter, power management, and an industry-standard **24-bit I2S interface**.

The I2S interface allows the INMP441 to be directly connected to digital processors such as DSPs and microcontrollers without the need for an external audio codec.  

The INMP441 has a high signal-to-noise ratio and is an excellent choice for near-field applications. It features a flat wideband frequency response, resulting in high-definition natural sound.

## Interface Definition

- **SCK**: Serial data clock for I2S interface  
- **WS**: Serial data word selection for I2S interface  
- **L/R**: Left/Right channel selection  
- When set to **low**, the microphone outputs a signal on the **left channel** of the I2S frame  
- When set to **high**, the microphone outputs a signal on the **right channel**  
- **SD**: Serial data output of the I2S interface  
- **VCC**: Input power, **1.8V to 3.3V**  
- **GND**: Power ground
